## Access is progressive 🔧🧭

SDCoLab access is designed to be simple: start with a visit, learn safety norms, then unlock tools through training.

```
VISIT → ORIENT → CERTIFY → BUILD
```

## Step 1: Visit 👀
Come see the space with no commitment.

Typical good first visits:
- **First Fridays** (monthly open house)
- **Sunday Open Shop** (weekly open build time)

Show up, introduce yourself, and ask for a quick tour.

## Step 2: Orientation 📋
Orientation covers:
- shop rules and expectations
- safety equipment + emergency basics
- tool access levels
- how to get help

After orientation, you can generally use basic areas/tools during staffed/open hours.

## Step 3: Certification 🎓
Many tools require certification:
- you learn safe operation
- you demonstrate competence
- your certification is recorded

No cert = no solo use. That’s a safety boundary, not a social boundary.

## Step 4: Build 🔨
Build during open/staffed hours and within your certification set.
As you take more classes, you unlock more capability.

## Access levels (typical)

| Level | What it means |
|---|---|
| 🟢 **Visitor** | tour, observe, attend open events |
| 🟡 **Oriented** | basic tool/space use during open hours |
| 🟠 **Certified** | specific tools you’re trained on |
| 🔴 **Member** | deeper access, storage, regular shop time |
| ⚫ **Key holder** | extended access (policy-dependent) |

## Ready to start?
1. visit on an open day
2. complete orientation
3. take one class that matches your first small project
