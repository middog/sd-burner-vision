## Your Path Into the Shop 🔧

Access to SDCoLab follows a natural progression. Start simple, grow from there.

```
VISIT → ORIENT → LEARN → BUILD
```

## Step 1: Visit 👀

Come see the space. No commitment, no pressure.

**Best times to visit:**

| Event | When | What to Expect |
|-------|------|----------------|
| **First Fridays** | 6–9 PM monthly | Open house, tours, social vibe |
| **Sunday Open Shop** | 12–5 PM weekly | People actively building |

Just show up. Introduce yourself. Look around. Ask questions.

## Step 2: Orient 📋

Complete the safety orientation (about 1 hour). You'll learn:

- Space rules and expectations
- Safety equipment locations
- Tool access levels
- How to get help when you need it

**After orientation:** You can use basic tools during staffed hours.

## Step 3: Learn 🎓

Take [classes](/classes/) to unlock access to specific tools.

Each class teaches safe operation and certifies you for unsupervised use. No certification = no access to that tool. (It's a safety thing, not a gatekeeping thing.)

## Step 4: Build 🔨

Use the space. Make your thing. Ask for help. Have fun.

- Open hours: Use your certifications
- More classes: Unlock more tools
- Build parties: Get help from the pack
- Need funding? [SDCAP grants](../sdcap/grants/) can help
