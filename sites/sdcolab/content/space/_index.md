## The Den 🏠

SDCoLab is your workshop. Here's what's inside.

## Areas

| Zone | Size/Type | What's There |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| **Main Workshop** | 2,500 sq ft | Welding, metal shop, wood shop, assembly |
| **Electronics Lab** | Dedicated room | Soldering, oscilloscopes, 3D printers, laser cutter |
| **Art Space** | Flex area | Painting, fabric/sewing, storage |
| **Outdoor Yard** | Covered | Large fabrication, fire testing |
| **Common Areas** | — | Kitchen, bathroom, library |

## Tool Access Levels

Tools are organized by certification requirements:

| Level | Examples | How to Get Access |
|-------|----------|-------------------|
| 🟢 **Basic** | Hand tools, assembly | Complete orientation |
| 🟡 **Intermediate** | Power tools, electronics | Take relevant class |
| 🔴 **Advanced** | Welding, laser, heavy equipment | Class + supervised hours |

**No certification for a tool = no using that tool.** This isn't gatekeeping—it's how we keep everyone safe and tools working.

## The Rules (Pack Code) 🐾

These exist because we learned them the hard way:

1. **Clean up after yourself** — Leave it better than you found it
2. **Put tools back where they belong** — Next person needs to find them
3. **Ask before using unfamiliar tools** — We'd rather show you than repair you
4. **Report damage immediately** — No blame, just fix
5. **No working alone on dangerous tools** — Buddy system, always
6. **No drugs/alcohol** — Should be obvious

## Safety First

| Item | Location |
|------|----------|
| **First aid kits** | Posted on walls in each area |
| **Fire extinguishers** | Main shop, electronics, yard |
| **Eye wash station** | Main shop |
| **Emergency exits** | Marked with signs |

**If something goes wrong:** Stop → Tell someone → We'll handle it together.
