## The workshop 🟡🏗️

SDCoLab is a shared build environment. Specific tooling can change over time; this page describes the typical layout and operating norms.

## Zones (typical)

| Zone | What it’s for |
|---|---|
| **Main workshop** | assembly, fabrication, woodworking/metalworking stations |
| **Electronics area** | soldering, small bench work, precision tasks |
| **Textiles / art area** | sewing, painting, soft goods, finishing |
| **Yard / outdoor** | large fabrication, messy work, testing (as allowed) |
| **Common areas** | storage, kitchen, library, admin |

## Tool access
Tools are generally grouped by required training:
- **basic:** orientation-level tools
- **intermediate:** class certification
- **advanced:** specialty certification + supervised hours (as required)

If you’re unsure, ask before powering up.

## Shop rules (minimal, important) 🥽
1. **Clean as you go.**
2. **Return tools to their homes.**
3. **Use only tools you’re trained/certified on.**
4. **Buddy up for higher-risk tools.**
5. **No intoxication in the shop.**
6. **Report damage immediately.**

## Safety
Know where:
- first aid kits
- fire extinguishers
- eye wash station (if present)
- exits

If something goes wrong: stop work, get help, report it. The goal is learning and prevention.

## Materials and storage
- scrap and surplus availability varies
- member lockers and project storage depend on policy and capacity
- abandoned projects are treated as donations after a defined period
