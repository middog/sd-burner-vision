## What's Getting Built 🔨

SDCoLab is home to dozens of ongoing projects—art cars, sculptures, interactive installations, costumes, and weird things that defy categorization.

**That's the point.** You bring the vision, we provide the fuel.

## Start Your Project

Remember the [Growth Path](../playa/how-we-gather/magic-of-3s/):

```
PROJECT → PARTY → PRACTICE
```

Most things should start as bounded **projects**. Here's how:

### 1. Come to Open Hours
Tour the space. See what's possible. Get inspired.

### 2. Get Oriented
Complete safety orientation. Takes about an hour.

### 3. Claim Space
Talk to a coordinator about storage and workspace needs.

### 4. Build!
Use the tools. Take [classes](/classes/). Ask for help. Make the thing.

## Need Funding?

Your project might qualify for an [SDCAP grant](../sdcap/grants/). Grants cover:

- Materials and supplies
- Specialized tools or equipment rental
- Event installation costs

**Don't be shy.** Many amazing projects started with a grant application.

## Project Residency

For larger projects that need dedicated space over time:

| Requirement | Detail |
|-------------|--------|
| Active member | In good standing |
| Defined project | Clear scope and timeline |
| Budget | For materials/consumables |
| Leave-no-trace | Commitment to clean exit |
| Check-ins | Weekly progress updates |

**Duration:** 1-3 months, renewable if on track.

**To apply:** Talk to the Space Coordinator.

## Build Parties 🎉

The best way to make progress: **invite the pack.**

- Your project, many hands
- Learning happens naturally
- Community bonds form
- Usually there's food

**Hosting a build party?** See [The SDCoLab Path](../playa/how-we-gather/sdcolab-path/) for how to set one up.
