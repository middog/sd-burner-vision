## Projects live here 🔨🟡

SDCoLab hosts ongoing builds: sculptures, interactive pieces, costumes, camp infrastructure, prototypes, repairs, and delightful nonsense.

A useful pattern for starting:

```
PROJECT → PARTY → PRACTICE
```

## Start a project (simple path)

1. **Visit during open hours** (see what’s possible)
2. **Complete orientation** (safety + norms)
3. **Take the class/cert you need** (for your smallest next step)
4. **Build the first version** (finishable > perfect)
5. **Invite help** (build parties turn solo work into community)

## Need funding?
Some builds may qualify for **[SDCAP grants]({{< xsite "sdcap" "grants/" >}})** (community-facing benefit, clear scope, stewardship).

## Project residency (when capacity allows)
For larger builds that need a defined footprint over time, SDCoLab may offer project residency or dedicated storage arrangements. Expect:
- a clear scope + timeline
- safety compliance
- regular check‑ins
- a clean exit plan (leave‑no‑trace for projects)

## Build parties 🎉
Build parties are how big work becomes possible:
- many hands
- shared learning
- shared ownership of the outcome (even when the vision is yours)

For process context: **[SDCoLab Path]({{< xsite "playa" "how-we-gather/sdcolab-path/" >}})**

*Make the first version. Then make it better—together.* 🟡🔥
