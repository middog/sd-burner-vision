## How SDCAP runs 🔵

SDCAP governance aims to be transparent, participatory, and in service of the community—consistent with the **[10 Principles]({{< xsite "playa" "culture/" >}})**.

## Structure

SDCAP is governed by an all‑volunteer **Board of Directors** (typically 5–9 members; 2‑year terms).

| Role | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| **President** | meeting facilitation, external representation |
| **Vice President** | support president, special projects |
| **Treasurer** | financial oversight, fiscal sponsorship |
| **Secretary** | records, documentation, communications |
| **Directors‑at‑large** | committee leadership, community liaison |

## Shared frameworks

We use a small set of shared language to keep coordination light:

- **Fire Triangle:** heat / oxygen / fuel → what’s missing?  
- **Growth Path:** project → party → practice  
- **3S:** sense → stabilize → strengthen  

More context: **[How We Gather]({{< xsite "playa" "how-we-gather/" >}})**

## Transparency commitments

As a 501(c)(3), we maintain openness where feasible:

- board meetings are open to observers (when possible)
- grant decisions include rationale where appropriate
- financial reporting available on request
- governance documentation maintained and shared publicly

## The “Yes, and…” stance

When something isn’t a fit, we aim to respond with:
acknowledgment → explanation → alternate path → connection → offer.

Context: **[Yes, And]({{< xsite "playa" "how-we-gather/magic-of-3s/yes-and/" >}})**
