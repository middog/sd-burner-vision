## How We Run 🔵

Our governance reflects the [10 Principles](../playa/culture/): transparent, participatory, and in service of the community.

## Structure

SDCAP is governed by an all-volunteer **Board of Directors** (5-9 members, 2-year terms).

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| **President** | Meeting facilitation, external representation |
| **Vice President** | Backup president, special projects |
| **Treasurer** | Financial oversight, fiscal sponsorship |
| **Secretary** | Records, documentation, communications |
| **Directors-at-Large** | Committee leadership, community liaison |

## Our Frameworks

We use shared language to stay aligned:

### 🔥 Fire Triangle — What's Missing?

| Element | SDCAP Role |
|---------|------------|
| 🔴 Heat | We don't provide this—**you do** |
| 🔵 Oxygen | **This is us:** enablement, info, process |
| 🟡 Fuel | We connect you to [SDCoLab](../sdcolab/) |

### 📈 Growth Path — How Things Evolve

```
PROJECT → PARTY → PRACTICE
```

Start small. Prove it works. Institutionalize what earns it.

### 🔄 3S Framework — How Work Matures

```
SENSE → STABILIZE → STRENGTHEN
```

Discover the shape → Bound the scope → Ship and document.

## Transparency Commitments

As a 501(c)(3), we're committed to openness:

- ✅ Financial reports available on request
- ✅ Board meetings open to observers
- ✅ Grant decisions include public rationale
- ✅ Annual report summarizes activities
- ✅ Governance documentation publicly available

## The "Yes... And!" Promise

When we can't directly support something, we will:

1. **Acknowledge** — "Yes, this sounds valuable"
2. **Explain** — Why it's not a fit for us to own
3. **Enable** — Here's how you can make it happen
4. **Connect** — Here's who might help
5. **Offer** — What support we *can* provide

**You will never hear just "no."**

## Get Involved

- **Attend meetings** — Monthly, open to community
- **Join a committee** — Grants, YOUtopia, Communications, Technology
- **Run for the board** — Elections at Annual Meeting
- **Provide feedback** — We read everything
