## Ways to engage 🔵🐾

SDCAP is volunteer‑run. The work moves when people step in.

## Quick paths

| If you want to… | Start here |
|---|---|
| Apply for funding | [Grants →]({{< relref "grants/_index.md" >}}) |
| Get event enablement support | [How to Engage →]({{< xsite "playa" "how-we-gather/sdcap-path/" >}}) |
| Explore fiscal sponsorship | [How to Engage →]({{< xsite "playa" "how-we-gather/sdcap-path/" >}}) |
| Help run programs | join a committee |
| Shape direction | run for the board |

## Join a committee

Committees do most of the execution. Examples:

| Committee | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Grants** | review proposals; recommend funding decisions |
| **YOUtopia** | plan and produce the regional event |
| **Communications** | outreach, documentation, updates |
| **Technology** | systems, infrastructure, digital tools |

To join: email **board@sdcap.org** or ask in the SDCAP Discord channel.

## Run for the board

Board service involves:
- monthly meetings (often 2–3 hours)
- committee participation
- stewardship responsibility (finance, risk, governance)

If you’re considering it, reach out early; we’re happy to explain the load.

## Donate

Donations support:
- art grants
- event insurance and enablement
- community infrastructure
- YOUtopia production
