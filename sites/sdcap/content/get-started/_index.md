## Ways to Engage 🐾

SDCAP is all-volunteer. Everything happens because people like you step up.

## Quick Paths

| If You Want To... | Do This |
|-------------------|---------|
| Get funding for art | [Apply for a grant](/grants/) |
| Support an event | [Learn about event support](../playa/how-we-gather/sdcap-path/) |
| Have us handle your taxes | Ask about fiscal sponsorship |
| Help run things | Join a committee |
| Shape the future | Run for the board |

## Join a Committee
