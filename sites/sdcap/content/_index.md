## SDCAP: nonprofit enablement 🔵💨

**SDCAP** is the 501(c)(3) that supports San Diego’s Burning Man community with the “oxygen layer”:
grants, fiscal sponsorship, insurance/event enablement, and transparent governance.

The intent is simple: **enable community-led art and events without owning them**.
