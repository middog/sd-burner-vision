## Grants: helping projects breathe 💸🔵

SDCAP grant programs support community‑facing art and projects aligned with the **[10 Principles]({{< xsite "playa" "culture/" >}})** and local community needs.

Programs and timelines vary by year; when cycles open, details and application links are announced through community channels.

## Grant programs

### 🎨 YOUtopia Art Grants
For art installed at San Diego’s regional burn.

| Detail | Typical info |
|---|---|
| **Timeline** | applications often open in spring |
| **Range** | commonly $500–$5,000 |
| **Fit** | interactive, installed at YOUtopia, artist stewardship present |

### 🌍 Community Project Grants
For projects outside YOUtopia that benefit the broader community.

| Detail | Typical info |
|---|---|
| **Timeline** | rolling or periodic review (varies) |
| **Range** | commonly $250–$2,000 |
| **Examples** | public art, community workshops, outreach builds |

## How to apply (high level)

1. Describe the project (what it is + why it matters)
2. Provide a budget and timeline
3. Explain community benefit / participation
4. Submit via the announced form during an open cycle
5. Respond to clarifying questions if the committee requests them

## What makes a strong proposal ✅
- clear scope and deliverables
- realistic budget (line items; not a wish list)
- achievable timeline
- community interaction and stewardship plan
- safety and leaving‑no‑trace considerations (when relevant)

## What we generally don’t fund ❌
- private/commercial benefit
- personal travel/tickets
- already‑completed work
- projects without a clear community-facing component

## Not sure if it fits?
Start with a short ask:
- **[Your First Ask]({{< xsite "playa" "how-we-gather/sdcap-path/first-ask/" >}})**  
- or email **grants@sdcap.org**

*Good proposals are clear, bounded, and community-facing.* 🔵
