- ✅ How it serves the community
- ✅ Alignment with the 10 Principles

## What We Don't Fund

- ❌ Private or commercial projects
- ❌ Personal travel or tickets
- ❌ Already completed work
- ❌ Projects without community benefit

## Not Sure If You Qualify?

**Just ask.** Seriously. We'd rather help you shape a good proposal than have you not apply.

- Or email grants@sdcap.org

**Remember:** We follow the [Yes... And!](/how-we-gather/magic-of-3s/yes-and/) philosophy. Even if your project isn't a fit for grants, we'll help you find another path.
