## The Oxygen That Lets Art Breathe 🔵

**San Diego Collaborative Arts Project (SDCAP)** is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit supporting the San Diego Burning Man community.

In our [Fire Triangle](/how-we-gather/), SDCAP is the **oxygen**—the enablement, logistics, and process that lets everything else happen. You can't see oxygen, but without it, fire can't breathe.

## Our Philosophy
