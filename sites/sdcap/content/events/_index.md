## YOUtopia 🏜️🔥

YOUtopia is San Diego’s official Burning Man regional event: a multi‑day, community‑built camping gathering rooted in the **[10 Principles]({{< xsite "playa" "culture/" >}})**.

Details vary by year; when in doubt, follow the official event communications.

| Detail | Typical info |
|---|---|
| **When** | October (often around Columbus Day weekend) |
| **Where** | Los Coyotes Indian Reservation |
| **Tickets** | spring/summer (varies) |
| **What** | art, music, fire, participation, community infrastructure |

## SDCAP-supported events

Throughout the year, SDCAP may support community events with:
- insurance certificates (when appropriate)
- amplification through official channels
- logistical guidance
- occasional funding pathways
