## What's a Fire Party? 🔥🎉

A Fire Party is a **45-60 minute working session** where we actually get things done together.

It's not a meeting where people report status.  
It's not a planning session where we talk about what we *might* do.  
It's a **momentum session** where things *move*.

---

## The Name

Why "Fire Party"?

- **Fire** = directed energy (not just heat, but actual flame)
- **Party** = we do it together, and we try to make it fun

The goal: keep the fire burning. 🔥

---

## The Structure (Three Parts, Of Course)

Every Fire Party follows the same rhythm:

### 1. Sense (10 minutes) 🔍

**Question:** What is the actual shape of things?

- Look at what's new since last time
- Ask: What's the real problem? Who's affected?
- Tag things with labels (fire triangle, stage, etc.)

**Don't solve yet.** Just see clearly.

---

### 2. Stabilize (20 minutes) ⚖️

**Question:** What needs to lock down?

For each important item:
- What stage is it at?
- What does "done" look like?
- What's the smallest next step?
- Who owns it?
- When do we check back?

If something can't stabilize, it needs more sensing. That's fine. Send it back.

---

### 3. Strengthen (15 minutes) 💪

**Question:** What can we push forward *right now*?

- Pick 1-3 things to actually work on
- Open a PR, draft content, send a message, make a decision
- Pair up if helpful

**This isn't "plan to do later."** This is "do it right now, together."

## What Gets Done

After every Fire Party:

| Output | Where It Lives |
|--------|----------------|
| Labels applied to issues | On each issue |

## Who Can Come?

**Everyone.**

- You don't need permission
- You don't need to be on a committee
- You don't need to have been before

**What you need:**
- Show up at the scheduled time
- Be willing to engage
- Bring something you want to move forward (optional but encouraged)

---

## How It's Different from Regular Meetings

| Fire Party | Regular Meeting |
|------------|-----------------|
| Working session | Discussion/decision session |
| Move issues forward | Make organizational decisions |
| Open to anyone | May have restricted attendance |
| 45 min, focused | Variable length |
| Produces artifacts (labels, assigns, recaps) | Produces minutes |

They complement each other. Fire Parties clear the path. Meetings decide direction.

---

## The Vibe

- **Time-boxed:** If something takes more than 5 minutes to discuss, create a sub-issue and move on
- **Celebratory:** Merged PRs and closed issues get acknowledgment
- **Concrete:** "Blocked on X" is useful. "Stuck" is not.
- **Shared:** We rotate who facilitates
- **Actually a party:** Music is encouraged. Snacks are welcome.

## How to Join

1. **Check the calendar** for Fire Party times
2. **Show up** (virtually or in person, depending on format)
3. **Jump in** — grab an issue, help triage, pair with someone

First time? Just observe and ask questions. That's totally valid.

## FAQ

**"What if I don't know GitHub/the tools?"**
> You can still participate! Fire Party handles the technical translation. You bring the ideas and energy.

**"What if I miss one?"**
> Check the recap. Catch up async. Come to the next one. No drama.

**"What if there's nothing I care about?"**
> Bring something! Or help someone else with their thing. That's gifting culture.

**"What if I disagree with how something is triaged?"**
> Speak up! Fire Party is collaborative. We'll talk it through.

## The Dog Metaphor 🐕

Imagine a pack of dogs at a park.

**Bad version:** They all sit around discussing which stick is most important to fetch. No sticks get fetched. Dogs get bored. Dogs wander off.

**Fire Party version:** "You grab that stick, I'll grab this one, let's meet at the bench, then we'll find more sticks together!" Sticks get fetched. Dogs stay engaged. More sticks appear.

**Fetch energy, not meeting energy.**

---

## Come Play

Fire Party is one of the best places to actually *do things* in this community. It's welcoming, it's productive, and it's (actually) fun.

Bring your thing. Or come help with someone else's thing. Either way, you're welcome.
