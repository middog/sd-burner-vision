## Why Three? 🐕🐕🐕

Three dogs are a pack. Three beats are a rhythm. Three points make a plane that doesn't wobble.

There's something primal about the number three. It's the smallest number that creates **pattern** and **stability**. One is a dot. Two is a line. Three is a *shape*.

We use patterns of three throughout our community because **three creates momentum**.

Let's dig into the magic. 🐾

## The Fire Triangle 🔥

You've probably seen this one already, but let's look at it fresh:

```
        🔥 FIRE
       / | \
      /  |  \
     /   |   \
   🔴---🔵---🟡
  HEAT  OXY  FUEL
```

| Element | Provides | Without It... |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 🔴 **Heat** | Energy, people, participation | Tools gather dust, plans stay plans |
| 🔵 **Oxygen** | Flow, info, enablement | Great ideas suffocate |
| 🟡 **Fuel** | Stuff, space, materials | Nothing to burn |

**The insight:** When something's stuck, don't just push harder. Ask: *which element is missing?*

Maybe your project has passionate people (heat) and great tools (fuel), but nobody knows how to navigate the permits (oxygen). The answer isn't more passion — it's finding someone who knows the paperwork.

**Three elements. One question. Where's the gap?**

---

## The Growth Path 📈

Ideas have a lifecycle. They start small and scrappy, then (if they earn it) they become part of how we do things.

```
PROJECT → PARTY → PRACTICE
```

| Stage | What It Is | Example |
|-------|------------|---------|
| **Project** | A bounded deliverable with a clear end | "Let's build this art piece" |
| **Party** | A time-boxed collaboration session | "Let's do a build day every month" |
| **Practice** | An ongoing ritual, stewardship, or maintenance | "We always have monthly build days now" |

**The insight:** Don't try to institutionalize something that hasn't proven itself. Start small. If it works, keep doing it. If it keeps working, *then* make it official.

Most ideas should stay **projects** — and that's fine! Not everything needs to become permanent. The goal isn't to create bureaucracy; it's to **earn** your place in how we operate.

**Three stages. One principle: prove it before you keep it.**

## The 3S Framework 🔄

This is about how work matures. Every piece of work moves through three stages:

```
SENSE → STABILIZE → STRENGTHEN
```

### 🔍 Sense

**Focus:** Discover the real shape. Gather signals. Name the problem.

- What's actually happening?
- Who's affected?
- What have we tried before?

**Don't:** Jump to solutions yet.  
**Do:** Listen. Observe. Sniff around. 🐕

*You can't scope what you don't understand.*

---

### ⚖️ Stabilize

**Focus:** Bound the scope. Pick owners. Reduce wobble.

- What exactly are we doing?
- What's in scope? What's out?
- Who owns it?
- What does "done" look like?
- When do we check back?

**Don't:** Ship something you haven't scoped.  
**Do:** Define the edges. Name the owner.

*A project without an owner is an orphan.*

---

### 💪 Strengthen

**Focus:** Ship. Document. Automate. Teach others.

- Execute the plan
- Write down what you learned
- Make it easier for next time
- Help others do it too

**Don't:** Hoard knowledge.  
**Do:** Leave a trail. Train the next dog.

*Done isn't done until someone else can do it.*

## How They Work Together

These frameworks aren't separate — they layer:

| Framework | Question |
|-----------|----------|
| **Fire Triangle** | What's *missing*? (Heat, Oxygen, or Fuel) |
| **Growth Path** | What *kind* of thing is this? (Project, Party, or Practice) |
| **3S Stage** | How *mature* is the work? (Sense, Stabilize, or Strengthen) |

**Example:**

> "We want to start a regular sewing night."

- **Fire Triangle:** Do we have heat (people interested)? Oxygen (someone to coordinate)? Fuel (machines and space)? → Looks like we need more **oxygen** — nobody's stepped up to organize.
- **Growth Path:** This is a **party** right now. If it keeps happening, it could become a **practice**.
- **3S Stage:** We're still **sensing** — we don't know how many people want this or what night works.

**Next step:** Post in Discord to gauge interest (sense), then pick a date and owner (stabilize), then actually host one (strengthen).

---

## Fire Party: Where 3s Come Alive 🔥🎉

A **Fire Party** is a 45-60 minute working session where we use all three frameworks to move work forward.

It's not a status meeting. It's a **momentum session**.

The agenda is — you guessed it — three parts:

### 1. Sense (10 min)
- Scan new issues
- Ask: What's the real problem? Who's affected?
- Quick-tag with labels

*Don't solve yet. Just see.*

### 2. Stabilize (20 min)
- Confirm what stage things are at
- Define "done" for priority items
- Assign owners (or flag as help-wanted)
- Set next touch dates

*Lock things down.*

### 3. Strengthen (15 min)
- Pick 1-3 items to advance *right now*
- Actually do the work together
- Pair up if helpful

*Not "plan to do later." Do it now.*

## Building Cultural Momentum

Here's the deep magic: **threes create rhythm, and rhythm creates momentum**.

When you have a consistent pattern:
- People know what to expect
- New folks can join mid-stream
- Progress becomes visible
- Energy compounds instead of dissipating

The three frameworks give us **shared language**. When I say "this is in the sense stage," you know exactly what I mean. When someone says "we need more heat," everyone understands.

**Shared language → Less friction → More flow → More fire.**

## The Pack Runs on Threes 🐕🐕🐕

Think about it:

- **Three sites:** PLAYA (heat), SDCAP (oxygen), SDCoLab (fuel)
- **Three growth stages:** Project → Party → Practice
- **Three work stages:** Sense → Stabilize → Strengthen
- **Three fire party segments:** Sense, Stabilize, Strengthen
- **Three types of access:** Public → Member → Resident

It's not that two is bad or four is wrong. It's that **three is the shape of motion**.

One foot up, one foot down, one foot forward. That's how you walk.

## The Fetch-Stick Philosophy 🦴

Here's one more way to think about it:

**SENSE** = Find the stick
**STABILIZE** = Pick up the stick  
**STRENGTHEN** = Bring it back

You can't pick up a stick you haven't found. You can't bring back a stick you haven't picked up.

But also: it's not about the stick. It's about the **running**. The joy is in the motion.

**Three parts. One fetch. Good dog.** 🐕
