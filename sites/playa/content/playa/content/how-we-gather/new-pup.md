  HEAT = You + Community = Come to events, participate
  FUEL = SDCoLab = Build things, use tools
OXYGEN = SDCAP = Get funding, make things official
```

**You are the fire.** Everything else exists to help you burn.

## Three Orgs, One Fire

| Who | What They Do | When You Need Them |
|-----|--------------|-------------------|
| **Community** (PLAYA) | Gather, create, participate | You want to show up, meet people, make things happen |
| **SDCoLab** | Makerspace, tools, workspace | You want to build something physical |
| **SDCAP** | Nonprofit, grants, fiscal support | You need money, insurance, or official backing |

## The Three Questions

When you're confused about how to move forward, ask yourself:

### 1. What's missing? (Fire Triangle)

| If you need... | That's... |
|----------------|-----------|
| People, energy, participation | 🔴 **Heat** |
| Info, process, funding | 🔵 **Oxygen** |
| Tools, space, materials | 🟡 **Fuel** |

### 2. What kind of thing is this? (Growth Path)

| If it's... | Call it a... |
|------------|--------------|
| A one-time deliverable | **Project** |
| A time-boxed collaboration | **Party** |
| An ongoing practice or ritual | **Practice** |

### 3. How mature is the work? (3S Stage)

| If you're... | You're in... |
|--------------|--------------|
| Still figuring out what the problem is | **Sense** |
| Defining scope, finding owners | **Stabilize** |
| Executing and shipping | **Strengthen** |

---

## Magic Words

| When you hear... | It means... |
|------------------|-------------|
| "Fire Triangle" | Heat + Oxygen + Fuel — which element is missing? |
| "3S" | Sense → Stabilize → Strengthen |
| "Fire Party" | Our working sessions (not meetings!) |
| "Yes... And!" | We don't just say "no" — we help find a path |
| "Project → Party → Practice" | Start small, prove it, then keep it |

---

## How to Ask for Things

### Simple stuff: Just ask.
Discord, email, in person. No form required.

### Bigger stuff:
- **Need tools/space?** → Talk to SDCoLab
- **Need money?** → Talk to SDCAP
- **Need people?** → Post in Discord, come to events
- **Not sure what you need?** → That's okay — just start talking

---

## The Golden Rules

1. **Show up.** That's 90% of it.
2. **Participate.** Don't be a spectator.
3. **Gift freely.** Give without expecting return.
4. **Ask questions.** Nobody knows everything.
5. **Help others.** We all lift together.
6. **Clean up.** Leave no trace.
7. **Don't be a gatekeeper.** We were all new once.

---

## If You Feel Lost

**Normal.** Everyone feels lost at first. This community has history, inside jokes, and established patterns. It takes time.

**Things that help:**
- Keep showing up (faces become familiar)
- Ask people their story (everyone loves to share)
- Find one person you click with (they'll introduce you to others)
- Volunteer for something small (you'll meet people who do things)

**Things that don't help:**
- Trying to know everything before participating
- Waiting to be invited (just show up)
- Comparing yourself to people who've been here years
