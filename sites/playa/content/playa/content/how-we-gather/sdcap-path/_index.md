## What is SDCAP? 🔵

**San Diego Collaborative Arts Project** is our 501(c)(3) nonprofit.

In plain speak: we're the paperwork that lets art happen.

Think of SDCAP as the **oxygen** in our fire triangle. You can't see oxygen, but without it, fire can't breathe. SDCAP handles the invisible stuff that lets everything else happen:

- Tax-deductible donations (so your gift gives more)
- Grants for art projects (so you can make the thing)
- Insurance for events (so we can gather safely)
- Fiscal sponsorship (so your wild idea can accept funding)

**SDCAP exists to enable, not to own.** We clear the path. You do the dancing.

## The Different Ways to Engage

### 🐕 Just Sniffing Around?

**You have a question. You're curious. You're not sure yet.**

That's totally fine. Just ask.

- Drop a message in Discord
- Email us
- Ask someone at an event

*Timeline: Usually answered within 48 hours*

**No forms. No process. Just reach out.** We're dogs, not robots.

---

### 🎪 Throwing an Event?

**You want to host something and need support.**

Maybe you need:
- An insurance certificate
- Help with permits
- Promotion through our channels
- Equipment or supplies
- Volunteer coordination

**How to do it:**

1. Contact events@ and tell us: what, when, where, who, how many
2. We'll respond within 72 hours
3. Bigger asks might need a simple agreement

**Pro tip:** Ask **30+ days** before your event. Rushing makes everything harder.

### 🎨 Need Funding for Art?

**You want to make something beautiful and need money to do it.**

**Grant programs** (when open):
- Art Grants — for specific projects
- Community Development Grants — for community-building initiatives
- Emergency Assistance — when life happens

**How grants work:**
1. Watch for announcements (website, Discord) when applications open
2. Apply by the deadline
3. We review and let you know within 30 days
4. If approved: sign agreement → get funds → make art → share what you learned

---

### 🏦 Fiscal Sponsorship

**Your project needs a 501(c)(3) to receive grants or tax-deductible donations, but you don't want to become a nonprofit yourself.**

We can be your umbrella. Your idea stays your idea — we just handle the tax paperwork.

**Requirements:**
- Your project aligns with our mission (arts + community + 10 Principles)
- You have a clear scope and timeline
- You're willing to do quarterly reporting
- You're okay with a small fee (5-10% of funds processed)

**How to apply:**
1. Submit a project proposal
2. Finance Committee reviews (about 14 days)
3. Board approval for big stuff
4. Sign the agreement
5. We give you our tax ID for donations
6. You report back quarterly

---

### 💡 Got a Big Idea?

**You think SDCAP should do something (or help with something) that we're not doing yet.**

We love ideas. Here's what makes a good proposal:

- **Clear problem** — What's broken or missing?
- **Specific solution** — What exactly are you proposing?
- **Bounded scope** — What's in? What's out?
- **Resource needs** — What does it take? (time, money, people)
- **Alignment** — How does this serve the community and the 10 Principles?

**The process:**
1. Write it up (use our template if helpful)
2. Submit to the relevant committee
3. They review and give feedback
4. Revise based on feedback
5. Committee recommends to board (if needed)
6. Board decides
7. We do the thing!

---

## The "Yes... And!" Promise 🎭

Here's something important about how we operate:

**You will never hear just "no."**

When SDCAP can't directly support something, we promise to:

1. **Acknowledge** — "Yes, this sounds valuable"
2. **Explain** — Why it's not a fit for us to own
3. **Enable** — Here's how you can make it happen anyway
4. **Connect** — Here's who might help
5. **Offer** — What support we *can* provide

This is improv. We say "yes, and..." — we build on ideas, we don't shut them down.
