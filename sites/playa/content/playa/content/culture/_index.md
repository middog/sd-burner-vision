## This Is Not a Festival

Burning Man isn't something you attend. It's something you create. There are no performers and audiences—only participants.

## The 10 Principles

- **Radical Inclusion** — Anyone may participate
- **Gifting** — Unconditional giving
- **Decommodification** — No commercial transactions
- **Radical Self-reliance** — Discover inner resources
- **Radical Self-expression** — No one determines your content
- **Communal Effort** — Creative cooperation
- **Civic Responsibility** — Care for community
- **Leaving No Trace** — Clean up everything
- **Participation** — No spectators
- **Immediacy** — Be present

## Consent Culture

Consent is foundational. Ask first for physical contact, photography, and participation. "No" is a complete sentence.

## Gifting Economy

Give without expectation of return. Don't barter. Receive gracefully.
