## Start a Thing

The best way to participate is to *do* something.

### Start a Party (Event)
Host a gathering—potluck, workshop, practice session, theme night. Events don't need permission, just someone willing to make them happen.

### Start a Project (Art)
Got an idea? Build it. Small projects can happen anywhere. Bigger projects might need CoLab space or SDCAP funding.

### Start a Practice (Ongoing)
Share a skill regularly. Weekly burn circle, monthly potluck, regular workshop. Consistency builds community.

## Your First Month

- **Week 1:** Join Discord, lurk, read
- **Week 2:** Attend one event
- **Week 3:** Attend a different event
- **Week 4:** Volunteer for something

By month's end, you'll know people and they'll know you.
