## What is Burning Man?

Burning Man is a week-long annual event in Nevada's Black Rock Desert. But it's not just a festival—it's a culture built on radical creativity, self-expression, community, and gifting.

That culture lives year-round in regional communities like ours.

## What Happens in San Diego?

We're one of the largest regional Burning Man communities in California. Throughout the year, we host events, build art at CoLab, fund projects through SDCAP, and produce YOUtopia—our annual regional burn.

## How Do I Get Involved?

**Show up.** That's the whole trick.

1. Come to an event — check the [calendar](/events/)
2. Say hi — we're friendly
3. Participate — bring something to share, help clean up
4. Keep showing up — community is built through consistency

There's no application. No membership. Just participation.
