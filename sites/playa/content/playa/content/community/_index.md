## Theme Camps

Theme camps are groups of people who come together around a shared concept. San Diego has dozens of active camps. The best way to find one is to come to events and meet people.

## How We Communicate

- **Discord** — Day-to-day coordination and chatter
- **Mailing List** — Low-volume major announcements
- **In Person** — The best communication happens face-to-face
