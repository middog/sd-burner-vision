## Culture is the contract 🔥🤝

Burning Man culture is built on participation: fewer spectators, more makers. The point isn’t to *attend*—it’s to co‑create.

Locally, this shows up as:
- people doing the work together
- gifts without strings
- shared care for each other and the space
- a bias toward “yes, and…” over gatekeeping

## The 10 Principles (a compass, not a rulebook)

| Principle | In practice |
|---|---|
| **Radical Inclusion** | welcome the stranger; make room |
| **Gifting** | give without expectation |
| **Decommodification** | protect the space from advertising/transactions |
| **Radical Self‑reliance** | bring what you need; solve your own problems |
| **Radical Self‑expression** | be authentic; let others be authentic |
| **Communal Effort** | build together; coordinate with care |
| **Civic Responsibility** | act like a responsible neighbor/citizen |
| **Leaving No Trace** | clean up completely; leave it better |
| **Participation** | do something; help, build, host, contribute |
| **Immediacy** | be present; show up for what’s happening now |

If you want the original reference list: Burning Man’s principles are hosted publicly (see their official page).

## Consent and care 🧠🫶

Consent is foundational. Ask first for:
- physical contact (including hugs)
- photos/video of individuals
- participation in activities that involve risk, intensity, or vulnerability

A clear **“no”** ends the thread. A clear **“yes”** includes context: boundaries, timing, and comfort level.

## Gifting and decommodification 🎁

Gifting is not barter. It’s contribution without a ledger:
- give what you can
- receive gracefully
- don’t keep score

Decommodification is how we keep that possible: fewer transactions, more relationship.

## Where this shows up operationally

When you need “official” structure—grants, governance, sponsorship—SDCAP is the oxygen layer:

- **[SDCAP governance →]({{< xsite "sdcap" "governance/" >}})**
