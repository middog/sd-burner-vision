## This Is Not a Festival 🔥

Burning Man isn't something you attend. It's something you **create**. There are no performers and audiences—only participants.

This is the **heat** in our Fire Triangle. You bring the energy. You bring the participation. Without you, there's no fire.

## The 10 Principles

These aren't rules. They're ideals—a compass, not a rulebook.

| Principle | What It Means | In Practice |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| **Radical Inclusion** | Anyone may participate | We welcome the stranger |
| **Gifting** | Unconditional giving | Give without expecting return |
| **Decommodification** | No commercial transactions | Community, not commerce |
| **Radical Self-reliance** | Discover inner resources | Bring what you need, solve your own problems |
| **Radical Self-expression** | No one determines your content | Be authentically you |
| **Communal Effort** | Creative cooperation | We build together |
| **Civic Responsibility** | Care for community | Take care of each other and our spaces |
| **Leaving No Trace** | Clean up everything | Leave it better than you found it |
| **Participation** | No spectators | Do, don't just watch |
| **Immediacy** | Be present | Experience the now |

**Want to go deeper?** See how we apply these to [governance and decisions](../sdcap/governance/).

## Consent Culture 🤝

Consent is foundational. Ask first for:
- Physical contact (hugs, touch, etc.)
- Photography
- Participation in activities

**"No" is a complete sentence.** Respect it. Always.

## Gifting Economy 🎁

The gifting economy isn't barter. It's not trade. It's genuinely giving without expecting anything back.

- Give freely
- Don't keep score
- Receive gracefully (accepting gifts is also a gift)

This creates **abundance**, not scarcity. When everyone gives, everyone receives.
