## Where the Heat Happens 🔥

Events are where community actually forms. From casual potlucks to fire spinning practice to all-night art builds—this is where we gather.

## Upcoming Events

*Check Discord for the latest calendar and announcements.*

## Event Types

| Type | What It Is | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Social** | Casual hangouts | Potlucks, game nights, happy hours |
| **Build** | Making things together | [SDCoLab](../sdcolab/) open shop, build parties |
| **Practice** | Skill sharing | Fire spinning, flow arts, workshops |
| **Burns** | Official regional events | YOUtopia, decompression |

## Want to Host? 🐕

Anyone can create a community event. **No permission needed.**

1. Have an idea
2. Pick a date (check the calendar to avoid conflicts)
3. Find a venue (park, house, [CoLab](../sdcolab/), wherever)
4. Post it to Discord
5. Show up and make it happen

**Events don't need to be fancy.** Some of our best gatherings started as "hey, want to come help me build this thing?"

**Need support?** [SDCAP](../sdcap/) can help with insurance, promotion, and resources for larger events. Check out [The SDCAP Path](/how-we-gather/sdcap-path/).
