## Events are where the heat becomes real 🔥👣

Calendars and websites help, but community forms in person: shared work, shared meals, shared moments.

Use this page as a starting point, then follow the live channels for the most current details.

## Upcoming events

For the latest posts, updates, and last‑minute changes, check the community channels (Discord) and the event listings shared there.

## Common event types

| Type | What it looks like |
|---|---|
| **Social** | potlucks, decompressions, hangs |
| **Build** | shop nights, build parties, mutual aid |
| **Practice** | fire/flow sessions, workshops, rehearsals |
| **Regional** | YOUtopia and related community milestones |

Build‑heavy events often happen at **[SDCoLab]({{< xsite "sdcolab" >}})**.

## Want to host something?

You can. Keep it simple.

1. Define a purpose (social, build, practice)
2. Pick a date/time and a location
3. Post it where people will see it (Discord + community calendar)
4. Show up early, leave the site clean, and follow through

If the ask is larger (insurance, permits, significant gear/coordination), SDCAP may be able to help:
