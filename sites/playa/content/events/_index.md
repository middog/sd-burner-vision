## Upcoming Events

Check out what's happening in the community. Events range from casual potlucks to fire spinning practice to art builds.

## Want to Host?

Anyone can propose a community event:

1. Have an idea
2. Pick a date (check calendar to avoid conflicts)
3. Find a venue
4. Post it to Discord

Events don't need to be fancy. Some of our best gatherings started as "hey, want to come help me build this thing?"
