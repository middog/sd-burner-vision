## PLAYA: the community hub 🔥🐾

**PLAYA** is where San Diego Burners gather year‑round: culture, events, and the practical “how do I plug in?” layer.
If you’re looking for people, a calendar, or a path from *curious* to *participating*, start here.

## Start here

| I want to… | Go here |
|---|---|
| Understand how the whole system works | [How We Gather →]({{< relref "how-we-gather/_index.md" >}}) |
| Find what’s happening next | [Events →]({{< relref "events/_index.md" >}}) |
| Learn the culture and expectations | [Culture →]({{< relref "culture/_index.md" >}}) |
| Get a simple on‑ramp | [Get Started →]({{< relref "get-started/_index.md" >}}) |
| Find community channels and camps | [Community →]({{< relref "community/_index.md" >}}) |

## The Fire Triangle

Our ecosystem is intentionally split into three functions:

| Site | Role | What you use it for |
|---|---|---|
| 🔴 **PLAYA** (this site) | Heat | People, gatherings, shared culture |
| 🔵 **[SDCAP]({{< xsite "sdcap" >}})** | Oxygen | Grants, fiscal sponsorship, governance, event enablement |
| 🟡 **[SDCoLab]({{< xsite "sdcolab" >}})** | Fuel | Space, tools, materials, classes, build time |

When something feels stuck, it’s usually because one element is missing: **heat**, **oxygen**, or **fuel**.

## New here?

- Read the one‑page **[New Pup Orientation →]({{< relref "how-we-gather/new-pup.md" >}})**  
- Pick one event and show up: **[Events →]({{< relref "events/_index.md" >}})**
- Ask one question in the community channels, then follow the thread 📌
