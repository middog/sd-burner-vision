## New here? This is the cheat sheet 🐾🧭

Bookmark this page. When something feels confusing, come back and run the three questions.

## The 30‑second model

```
                🔥 FIRE
        (what we create together)

        🔴 HEAT      🔵 OXYGEN      🟡 FUEL
      (people)   (enablement)   (space/tools)
```

- **Heat** = community participation (PLAYA)
- **Oxygen** = grants / sponsorship / governance (SDCAP)
- **Fuel** = makerspace resources (SDCoLab)

## Three orgs, one ecosystem

| Who | What it does | When you reach for it |
|---|---|---|
| **PLAYA** | culture, events, community | you want to show up / meet people / participate |
| **SDCoLab** | makerspace, tools, build time | you want to build something physical |
| **SDCAP** | nonprofit enablement | you need funding, insurance, fiscal sponsorship, or formal support |

## A first month that works

### Week 1: orient
- [ ] join the community channels (Discord)
- [ ] skim **[Culture]({{< relref "culture/_index.md" >}})**
- [ ] pick one date from **[Events]({{< relref "events/_index.md" >}})**

### Week 2: show up once
- [ ] attend one event
- [ ] learn one name
- [ ] ask one practical question

### Week 3: return
- [ ] go again (same crew or different crew)
- [ ] offer a small help (setup / teardown / cleanup)

### Week 4: do something
- [ ] volunteer for a small task
- [ ] or start a tiny project you can finish in a week

## The three questions

### 1) What’s missing? (Fire Triangle)

| If you need… | That’s… |
|---|---|
| people, energy, participation | 🔴 **Heat** |
| process, funding, “official” support | 🔵 **Oxygen** |
| space, tools, materials | 🟡 **Fuel** |

### 2) What kind of thing is this? (Growth Path)

| If it’s… | Call it a… |
|---|---|
| a bounded deliverable | **Project** |
| a time‑boxed collaboration | **Party** |
| an ongoing ritual / stewardship | **Practice** |

### 3) How mature is the work? (3S)

| If you’re… | You’re in… |
|---|---|
| still discovering the real problem | **Sense** |
| scoping and assigning ownership | **Stabilize** |
| executing, documenting, teaching forward | **Strengthen** |

## How to ask for help

Start with three lines:

1. **What you’re trying to do**
2. **What you think you need** (or say “not sure”)
3. **When** (roughly)

That’s enough to route you to the right place.

## Community basics

- consent first (touch, photos, participation)
- leave no trace (including micro‑trash)
- participate (help beats hype)
- don’t gatekeep (we were all new)
