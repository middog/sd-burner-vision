## What SDCoLab is 🟡

**SDCoLab (San Diego Collaborative Lab)** is the community makerspace. In the Fire Triangle, it provides **fuel**: space, tools, materials, and skill‑sharing that turn ideas into physical reality.

You’ll see SDCoLab show up as:
- open shop hours and tours
- classes + tool certifications
- build parties and project nights
- shared resources (scrap, surplus, group buys)

For the canonical details (hours, location, policies), use the SDCoLab site:

- **[SDCoLab site →]({{< xsite "sdcolab" >}})**

## Common ways to engage

### 🟢 Visit (drop-in)
Best for: getting oriented, meeting people, seeing what’s possible.

- show up during open hours / open house
- sign a waiver if required
- ask for a quick tour
- watch the workflow and the safety culture

### 🟡 Join (member access)
Best for: regular shop time, storage, deeper involvement.

Typical steps:
1. orientation
2. tool certifications (per area)
3. agreement + dues (as applicable)

### 🔴 Residency (space for larger builds)
Best for: big projects that need a dedicated footprint and a timeline.

Expect:
- a defined scope + end date
- regular check-ins
- a clean exit plan (leave-no-trace for projects)

## Safety isn’t optional 🥽

The makerspace runs on a simple rule: **protect the pack**.

- use only tools you’re trained/certified on
- wear proper PPE
- clean as you go
- report damage immediately (no blame—just safety)

## Start here

- First visit workflow: **[Your First Build →](first-build/)**  
- Access and policies: **[Get access →]({{< xsite "sdcolab" "access/" >}})**
