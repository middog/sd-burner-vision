## What is SDCoLab? 🟡

**San Diego Collaborative Lab** is our makerspace.

In plain speak: it's where things get built.

Think of SDCoLab as the **fuel** in our fire triangle. Fuel is the stuff that burns — the wood, the material, the substance. Without fuel, there's nothing for the fire to consume, nothing to transform into heat and light.

SDCoLab provides:
- Workshop space (a den to work in)
- Tools and equipment (the chew toys of creation)
- Materials and supplies (nom nom)
- Hands-on expertise (wise elder dogs)
- Classes and build parties (pack activities)

**SDCoLab exists to provide resources, not gatekeep them.** Come make things.

## The Tool Library 🔧

We've got tools. Lots of tools. Here's how they're organized:

| Category | Examples | Certification Needed |
|----------|----------|---------------------|
| **Hand Tools** | Hammers, saws, wrenches | None — just use 'em |
| **Power Tools (Basic)** | Drills, sanders, jigsaws | Basic cert |
| **Power Tools (Advanced)** | Table saw, miter saw | Advanced cert |
| **Welding** | MIG, TIG, stick | Welding cert |
| **CNC/Laser** | CNC router, laser cutter | Specialty cert |
| **Sewing/Textiles** | Sewing machines, sergers | Basic cert |

### How Checkout Works

1. Check availability in the tool library system
2. Reserve if needed
3. Inspect the tool at checkout (make sure it's not already broken)
4. Return it clean and functional
5. Report any damage immediately
6. Late returns = suspension of privileges

### Getting Certified

1. Sign up for a certification class
2. Complete the classroom portion (don't skip!)
3. Demonstrate safe operation
4. Pass the quiz
5. Certification added to your profile

**Be patient with yourself.** Learning tools takes time. That's okay.

## Safety Rules — The Pack Protects the Pack 🐾

These aren't bureaucracy. They're how we take care of each other.

### Universal Rules (Always Apply)

- **Closed-toe shoes required.** No flip-flops in the shop.
- **Safety glasses in shop areas.** Protect your eyeballs.

- **Clean as you go.** Don't leave messes for the next person.

### Tool-Specific Safety

- Follow posted procedures for each tool
- Use required PPE (posted at each station)
- Don't use tools you're not certified for
- **When in doubt, ask.** Seriously.

### When Things Go Wrong

- **All injuries get reported immediately.** No exceptions.
- **Near-misses get reported too.** They help us prevent real injuries.
