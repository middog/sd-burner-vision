## From idea to object 🟡🔧

Your first build doesn’t need to be ambitious. It needs to be **finishable**, **safe**, and **real**.

A simple path:

```
IDEA → VISIT → LEARN → BUILD → SHARE
```

## 1) IDEA 💡
Start with one sentence:
- “I want to build a small light piece for an event.”
- “I want to learn welding and make something tiny.”
- “I want to fabricate a bracket / sign / costume element.”

It can evolve later. A first sentence is enough.

## 2) VISIT 👀
Before you commit, see the space.

Good first touchpoints:
- open shop hours
- open houses
- an intro class (if offered)

During your visit:
- look at what’s actually available
- ask what tool training is required
- notice workflow and cleanup expectations

## 3) LEARN 🎓
Certain tools require training/certification. That’s not gatekeeping; it’s how injuries stay rare and tools stay usable.

- start with the tool area you need for the smallest next step
- take the relevant class/cert
- ask for a quick demo when available

## 4) BUILD 🔨
A good first build:
- uses tools you’re cleared to use
- fits within open hours / your reservation window
- can be cleaned up in one session

If you’re working on something larger, look into:
- membership access
- project residency (dedicated footprint + timeline)

## 5) SHARE 🎁
Share closes the loop:
- post a photo + a short note (what worked / what didn’t)
- bring the object to a gathering
- teach one tiny thing you learned

## If something goes wrong
- stop
- ask for help
- report tool damage immediately

No shame, no blame—just safer work.

## Need help?
Fastest route is usually:
- ask in the SDCoLab channels (Discord)
- ask during open hours
- take a class and talk to the instructor/lead

*Small build → real object → more confidence.* 🟡🔥
