## You Want to Make Something. Let's Go. 🔧

You've got an idea. Maybe it's a sculpture. Maybe it's a costume piece. Maybe it's "I want to learn to weld" and you don't have a specific project yet.

All of that is valid. Here's how to turn *want* into *made*.

---

## The Path

```
IDEA → VISIT → LEARN → BUILD → SHARE
```

Let's walk through each step.

---

## 1. IDEA 💡

You have something in mind. It might be:

- **Specific:** "I want to build a 6-foot metal flower that shoots fire"
- **Vague:** "I want to make something with wood"
- **Skill-focused:** "I want to learn the laser cutter"

All valid starting points. Write it down somewhere, even if it's just "make a thing."

**Hot tip:** It's okay if your idea changes. Most projects evolve. Start somewhere.

---

## 2. VISIT 👀

Come see the space before committing to anything.

**Easy ways to visit:**

- 🎉 **Open Build Day** — Drop in, no reservation needed
- 📚 **Class** — Take an intro workshop
- 🐾 **Tour** — Ask for a walkthrough

During your visit:

- Look around at what tools exist
- Watch other people work (ask before interrupting)
- Ask questions — "What's that?" "How would I make X?"
- Get a feel for the vibe

**Remember:** Sign the waiver on your first visit.

---

## 3. LEARN 📖

Before you can use certain tools, you need to learn them safely.

### For Simple Things

Hand tools, basic stuff — just ask someone to show you. No formal process.

### For Power Tools

You'll need certification:

1. **Sign up for a cert class** (check the calendar)
2. **Attend the class** (classroom + hands-on)
3. **Demonstrate safe operation** (show you can do it)
4. **Pass the quiz** (it's not hard)
5. **Get certified** (logged in your profile)

### For Complicated Things

Welding, CNC, laser cutter — these have specialty certifications. Same process, just more intensive.

**Don't rush this.** Tools can hurt you if you don't respect them. We want you to make art, not visit the ER.

---

## 4. BUILD 🔨

Now the fun part.

### For Small Projects

- Come to an Open Build Day
- Bring your materials (or scavenge from the scrap pile)
- Use the tools you're certified for
- Ask for help when you need it
- Clean up when you're done

### For Bigger Projects

Consider:

- **Membership** — Regular access, your own locker
- **Project Residency** — Dedicated space for larger builds

### Build Party Magic

The best builds happen together. Join a Build Party:

- Someone else's project? Volunteer to help. You'll learn.
- Your project? Invite others. Many hands make light work.

**Gifting economy:** Help others build, and they'll help you build. That's how it works.

---

## 5. SHARE 🎁

Made something? Don't hide it!

- 📸 **Post photos** in Discord
- 🎪 **Bring it to an event**
- 🎓 **Teach what you learned**
- 📝 **Document your process** (helps the next person)

Art isn't art until someone experiences it. Let people see your work.

## Common First Projects

Not sure what to make? Here are some classics:

| Project | Skill Level | What You'll Learn |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Wooden sign** | Beginner | Cutting, sanding, finishing |
| **Simple LED piece** | Beginner | Basic electronics |
| **Metal bottle opener** | Beginner | Grinding, metalwork basics |
| **Costume piece** | Varies | Sewing, materials |
| **Small sculpture** | Intermediate | Mixed media, fabrication |
| **Fire prop** | Advanced | Welding, fuel systems, safety |

Ask around for what's achievable with your current skills.

---

## What If I Mess Up?

You will. Everyone does. That's how learning works.

**If you break a tool:**
- Stop
- Tell someone immediately
- Don't try to hide it

**No blame culture.** We'd rather know about a broken tool than have the next person get hurt.

**If your project fails:**
- Learn from it
- Try again (or try something else)
- Talk about what went wrong (others can learn too)

Failure is just research. 🔬
