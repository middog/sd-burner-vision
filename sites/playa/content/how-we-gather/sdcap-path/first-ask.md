## You Have a Need. We Might Help. Let's Talk. 🐕

Maybe you've got an idea. Maybe you need funding. Maybe you're not even sure what you need yet.

That's okay. Here's how to start.

---

## The "Just Ask" Rule

For most things, you don't need a form. You don't need permission. You just... ask.

**Ways to reach out:**

- 💬 Drop a message in Discord (#ask-sdcap or just wherever)
- 📧 Email: info@[domain]
- 👋 Find a board member at an event and say hi
- 🐾 Literally just ask anyone who seems to know things

**Timeline:** We try to respond within 48 hours. If we don't, ping us again. We're volunteers — things slip sometimes.

---

## What to Include in Your Ask

The more specific you are, the faster we can help. But we don't need a formal proposal. Just tell us:

1. **What you're trying to do** (in a sentence or two)
2. **What kind of help you need** (money? advice? connections? not sure?)
3. **When it needs to happen** (next week? next month? no rush?)

That's it. We'll take it from there.

## Example Asks

> "Hey, I want to build a fire art piece for YOUtopia and I've never done this before. Who should I talk to?"

> "My camp is thinking about applying for a grant. What's the process?"

> "I'm organizing a workshop and wondering if I can use CoLab space. How does that work?"

> "I have this weird idea and I don't know if it's feasible. Can I bounce it off someone?"

All of these are great. All of them will get a response.

---

## What Happens Next

After you ask, someone will:

1. **Acknowledge** — "Got it, thanks for reaching out!"
2. **Clarify** — "Can you tell me more about X?"
3. **Route** — "Let me connect you with the right person/committee"
4. **Respond** — "Here's what we can offer..."

If we can't help directly, we'll tell you who might. That's the **Yes... And!** promise.

## Common Questions from New Folks

**"Is my idea too small/weird/ambitious?"**
> There's no such thing. Bring it.

**"I don't know anyone. Will they take me seriously?"**
> Yes. We welcome the stranger. That's Principle #1.

**"What if I ask the wrong person?"**
> They'll point you to the right one. No drama.

**"Do I need to be a member/donor/something to ask?"**
> Nope. Just be you.

## When You Need More Than a Quick Answer

If your need is bigger (fiscal sponsorship, major grant, project proposal), we'll walk you through the formal process. But you still start by asking.

- **Fiscal sponsorship** → Treasurer will reach out
- **Grants** → Grants Committee will explain the cycle
- **Event support** → Events Committee will help plan
- **Technology** → Tech Committee will evaluate

You don't need to know which committee to contact. We'll route you.

## The Vibe

We're here to **clear the path**, not add to the maze.

If you ever feel like you're getting bureaucratic runaround, tell us. That's not how we want to operate. We're dogs, not cats. We come when called. 🐕

*Confused? Curious? Just ask. That's the whole trick.* 🔵
