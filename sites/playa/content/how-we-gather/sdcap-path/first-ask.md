## Start with a small, clear ask 🧾🔵

You don’t need to understand the org chart to begin. You just need to describe the shape of your need.

## Where to ask

Use whichever channel is easiest:
- community Discord (SDCAP-related channel/thread)
- email listed on the **[SDCAP site]({{< xsite "sdcap" >}})**  
  (common contacts include **board@sdcap.org** for general questions and **grants@sdcap.org** for grant questions)

If you ask the “wrong” person, you’ll get routed. That’s normal.

## What to include (three lines)

1. **What you’re doing** (1–2 sentences)
2. **What you need** (money? insurance? advice? “not sure”)
3. **When** (a rough timeline + any deadlines)

Optional but helpful:
- a rough budget range
- where it’s happening
- who’s involved (even “just me so far”)

## Examples

> “I’m building a small interactive sculpture for YOUtopia. I may need partial funding for materials. Timeline is March–October.”

> “We’re hosting a workshop for ~30 people in a park next month. Do we need insurance? If so, what’s the process?”

> “We want to accept donations for an art project but don’t have a nonprofit. Is fiscal sponsorship a fit?”

## What happens next

Typically you’ll get:
1. acknowledgment + a clarifying question (if needed)
2. routing to the right committee/person
3. a clear answer: **yes**, **not yet**, or **no—here’s an alternate path**

## If your ask is “big”

You can still start with a message. For larger requests (fiscal sponsorship, major grants, complex events), expect an agreement and a little more structure—mostly to keep everyone protected and aligned.
