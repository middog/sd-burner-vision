## What SDCAP is 🔵

**SDCAP (San Diego Collaborative Arts Project)** is the community’s 501(c)(3) nonprofit. In the Fire Triangle, it provides **oxygen**: the administrative and financial structures that let art and events breathe.

SDCAP typically supports:
- grants and community funding
- fiscal sponsorship (processing tax‑deductible donations for projects)
- event enablement (insurance, guidance, coordination)
- governance and transparent decision‑making

SDCAP’s role is to **enable** community work—not to own it.

## When to reach for SDCAP

| If you need… | SDCAP can help with… |
|---|---|
| 💸 Funding for art/community work | grants and funding pathways |
| 🧾 Tax‑deductible donations | fiscal sponsorship / donation processing |
| 📋 Insurance / “official” support | certificates, guidance, logistics |
| 🤝 Navigation | connecting you to experienced humans |
| 📚 Process clarity | how decisions get made; what’s required |

## How to engage

### 1) A quick question (start here)
You don’t need a form to begin. Send a short note with:
- what you’re trying to do
- what you think you need (or “not sure”)
- when it’s happening

Then SDCAP can route you.

**Start:** **[Your First Ask →](first-ask/)**

### 2) Event support
If your gathering needs insurance, permits, or heavier coordination, start early.

- Describe the event (what/when/where/expected size)
- Say what support you’re asking for
- Include any deadlines (parks, venues, vendors)

### 3) Grants
Grant cycles and programs vary. A strong request usually includes:
- a clear description
- a realistic budget
- a timeline
- community benefit / interactivity

### 4) Fiscal sponsorship
Use this when your project needs a 501(c)(3) umbrella to receive grants or tax‑deductible donations, without forming your own nonprofit.

Expect:
- a short proposal + scope
- basic reporting
- an agreement that protects both sides

### 5) Proposals and new ideas
If you want SDCAP to do something new, bring a bounded proposal:
- problem → proposal → scope → resources → alignment
