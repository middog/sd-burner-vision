## Fire Party = a working session 🔥⏱️

A Fire Party is a **45–60 minute** time‑boxed session where we move real work forward.
Not status. Not vibes-only discussion. Output.

## Why the name?
- **Fire:** directed energy (not just warmth)
- **Party:** shared effort, low friction, human‑friendly

## The structure (three beats)

### 1) Sense (≈10 min) 🔍
- scan what’s new
- clarify the actual problem
- tag what’s missing (heat/oxygen/fuel) and what stage it’s in

### 2) Stabilize (≈20 min) ⚖️
For priority items:
- define “done”
- pick an owner (or mark help‑wanted)
- set the next touch date

### 3) Strengthen (≈15–30 min) 💪
- do 1–3 concrete actions *now*
- draft the doc, open the PR, write the copy, make the call

## What “done” looks like
After a Fire Party, you should be able to point to artifacts:
- updated issue labels / owners
- a short recap posted where others can find it
- a few items that moved forward measurably

## Who can attend?
Anyone who wants to help. Observing is allowed. Asking questions is allowed.

## How to join
Fire Parties are announced through community channels. Show up, pick one small thing, and move it.
