## Why three? 🐾

Three creates a stable shape: a tripod, a triangle, a rhythm you can repeat.
We use “threes” as lightweight structure—enough to coordinate, not enough to smother.

## 1) Fire Triangle 🔥
A diagnostic, not a slogan.

| Element | Means | When it’s missing… |
|---|---|---|
| 🔴 **Heat** | people + participation | nothing moves; no one shows |
| 🔵 **Oxygen** | enablement + process | good ideas stall or suffocate |
| 🟡 **Fuel** | space + tools + materials | there’s nothing physical to build with |

When something is stuck, ask: **Which element is missing?**

## 2) Growth Path 📈

```
PROJECT → PARTY → PRACTICE
```

| Stage | Use it for |
|---|---|
| **Project** | bounded deliverables with an end |
| **Party** | time‑boxed collaboration sessions |
| **Practice** | ongoing rituals and stewardship |

Rule of thumb: **prove it as a project**, strengthen it as a party, then keep it as a practice only if it stays healthy.

## 3) 3S work stages 🔄

```
SENSE → STABILIZE → STRENGTHEN
```

- **Sense:** discover the real problem; gather signals
- **Stabilize:** bound scope; pick an owner; define “done”
- **Strengthen:** execute; document; teach forward; reduce future friction

## Putting it together
Use the three lenses in order:

1. **Fire Triangle:** what’s missing?
2. **Growth Path:** what kind of thing is this?
3. **3S:** what stage is it in right now?

## Quick reference

```
🔥 Missing?    Heat / Oxygen / Fuel
📈 Kind?       Project → Party → Practice
🔄 Stage?      Sense → Stabilize → Strengthen
```
