## “Yes, and…” as a default stance 🎭

In improv, “Yes, and…” keeps a scene moving.
In community work, it keeps momentum alive: we try to redirect energy toward a workable path instead of shutting it down.

This is not a promise that every idea gets funded or adopted. It *is* a promise that you’ll get a **useful** response.

## The five-step response

When something isn’t a fit, we aim to:

| Step | What it looks like |
|---|---|
| **Acknowledge** | “This is valuable / interesting.” |
| **Explain** | “Here’s why it doesn’t fit our mission/capacity.” |
| **Enable** | “Here’s a way to do it anyway.” |
| **Connect** | “Here’s who has done something similar.” |
| **Offer** | “Here’s what we *can* provide.” |

## Examples (pattern, not script)

### Weekly fire practice
- Acknowledge: valuable
- Explain: capacity constraints
- Enable: make it community‑led
- Connect: experienced leads
- Offer: promotion + guidance; possibly support if it scales

### Funding a private studio
- Acknowledge: artists need space
- Explain: grants fund community‑accessible benefit
- Enable: residency / workshops / shared access hours
- Connect: other grant sources
- Offer: help shape a proposal that serves the wider community

## When the answer is truly “no”
Sometimes the clean answer is “no” (values, safety, legality, capacity).
Even then, the goal is clarity without contempt: explain the boundary and leave the door open for a different idea.

## What we ask in return
If we give you a path:
- try walking it
- follow up if you get stuck
- share what you learned so the next person moves faster
