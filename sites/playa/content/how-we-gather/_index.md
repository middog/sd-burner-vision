## Welcome to the Pack 🐾

Hey there, beautiful human. You found us.

Maybe you heard about Burning Man and wondered what all the fuss is about. Maybe you've already been to the playa and you're looking for your people back home. Maybe someone you love keeps disappearing to "build things" and you want to know where.

Whatever brought you here: **welcome home.**

## The Fire Triangle 🔥

Here's a little secret about fire: it doesn't happen alone.

Fire needs three things to burn. Not two. Not one. **Three.**

```
      🔥
     /   \
    /     \
   / FIRE  \
  /    🐕    \
 /____________\
🔴            🟡
HEAT         FUEL
  \         /
   \   💨  /
    \ 🔵 /
   OXYGEN
```

Take away any one of them, and the flame goes out.

Our community works the same way:

| Element | What It Is | Who Provides It |
|---------|------------|-----------------|
| 🔴 **Heat** | The energy. The people. The spark. | **You.** The community. Everyone who shows up. |
| 🟡 **Fuel** | The stuff. The space. The tools. | **SDCoLab.** Our makerspace where things get built. |
| 🔵 **Oxygen** | The flow. The info. The enablement. | **SDCAP.** Our nonprofit that makes things possible. |

**None of these is more important than the others.** You can have all the tools in the world (fuel), all the permits and funding (oxygen), but without people who care (heat)? Nothing burns.

And that's why we say: **You are the fire.** 🔥

## Three Paths Into the Flame

Depending on what you need, there are different ways to engage:

### 🔴 Just Show Up

You want to **participate**. Meet people. Feel the vibe. Dance around the fire.

**Start here:** Come to [events](/events/). Say hi. That's literally it.

*The heat builds when we gather.*

### 🟡 Build Something

You want to **create**. Make art. Use tools. Get your hands dirty.

**Learn about:** [The SDCoLab Path →](sdcolab-path/)

*The fuel feeds the flame.*

### 🔵 Make Things Happen

You want to **enable**. Get funding. Support events. Help the machine run.

**Learn about:** [The SDCAP Path →](sdcap-path/)

*The oxygen lets the fire breathe.*

## It's All About the 3s

You might notice we like the number three around here. 🐕🐕🐕

That's not an accident. Three is the smallest number that makes a pattern. It's stable like a tripod. It's the beginning of rhythm.

We use patterns of three everywhere:

- **Fire Triangle:** Heat + Fuel + Oxygen
- **Growth Path:** Project → Party → Practice  
- **Work Stages:** Sense → Stabilize → Strengthen

## No Gatekeeping. Ever.

Here's what you won't find here: velvet ropes, secret passwords, or people telling you "that's not how we do things."

If someone acts like a gatekeeper, they've missed the point. Every one of us was new once. We welcome the stranger. That's literally [Principle #1](/culture/).

So don't be shy. Ask questions. Make mistakes. Try things.

**The pack runs together.** 🐾
