## The map 🧭🔥

This community is intentionally structured as a **Fire Triangle**: three roles that together make the work sustainable.

When you know which role you need, you can move fast—without guessing who to ask or where to start.

## The Fire Triangle

| Element | What it is | Where it lives |
|---|---|---|
| 🔴 **Heat** | people, participation, culture | **PLAYA** (community hub) |
| 🔵 **Oxygen** | enablement: grants, sponsorship, governance, “official” support | **[SDCAP]({{< xsite "sdcap" >}})** |
| 🟡 **Fuel** | space, tools, materials, hands‑on making | **[SDCoLab]({{< xsite "sdcolab" >}})** |

If something is stuck, ask: **which element is missing?**

## Three practical paths

### 🔴 Show up (Heat)

You want to meet people, participate, and learn by doing.

- Start with **[Events]({{< relref "events/_index.md" >}})**
- Bring a small contribution (help, cleanup, a skill, a snack)
- Come back once more within a month

### 🟡 Build (Fuel)

You want to make something physical: art, costumes, infrastructure, experiments.

- Start with **[The SDCoLab Path →](sdcolab-path/)**  
- Or go straight to **[Your First Build →](sdcolab-path/first-build/)**

### 🔵 Enable (Oxygen)

You need funding, fiscal sponsorship, insurance, or guidance through “official” processes.

- Start with **[The SDCAP Path →](sdcap-path/)**  
- Or begin with **[Your First Ask →](sdcap-path/first-ask/)**

## Shared frameworks (the house language)

You’ll see a few repeating patterns:

- **Growth Path:** Project → Party → Practice  
- **Work stages:** Sense → Stabilize → Strengthen  
- **Response style:** “Yes, and…” (redirect toward possibility)

If you want the full explanation:

## Quick start checklist

1. Read **[New Pup Orientation]({{< relref "how-we-gather/new-pup.md" >}})**
2. Pick one date → **[Events]({{< relref "events/_index.md" >}})**
3. Ask one question (in Discord or in person)
4. Do one small thing that helps
