## Participation, scaled 🚀🐾

A reliable on‑ramp is to do something small—then let it grow only if it earns it.

```
PROJECT → PARTY → PRACTICE
```

- **Project:** a bounded deliverable (ends on purpose)
- **Party:** a time‑boxed collaboration session (build day, workshop, meetup)
- **Practice:** an ongoing ritual (stewarded, repeatable, shared)

### Project: make a thing 🎯
Examples:
- a small LED piece
- a costume element
- a tiny interactive gift for an event

If you need **space/tools**, look at **[SDCoLab]({{< xsite "sdcolab" >}})**.  
If you need **funding/official support**, look at **[SDCAP]({{< xsite "sdcap" >}})**.

### Party: host a moment 🎉
Examples:
- a potluck
- a build night
- a workshop
- a park practice session

You don’t need permission to host a community gathering. You need a date, a place, and follow‑through.

### Practice: keep it alive 🔁
Examples:
- a monthly build day
- a recurring skills night
- a standing volunteer crew

Consistency is how culture becomes real.

## A first‑month plan

### Week 1: orient 🧭
- Read **[Culture]({{< relref "culture/_index.md" >}})**
- Browse **[Events]({{< relref "events/_index.md" >}})** and pick one date
- Skim **[New Pup Orientation]({{< relref "how-we-gather/new-pup.md" >}})**

### Week 2: show up 👣
- Attend one event
- Learn one name
- Ask one practical question

### Week 3: return 🔥
- Go again (different event if you want)
- Offer a small help (setup, teardown, cleanup, logistics)

### Week 4: do something 🧩
- Volunteer for a small task
- Or start a tiny project you can finish in a week

## Need a path?

- **[The SDCAP Path →]({{< relref "how-we-gather/sdcap-path/_index.md" >}})** (funding, sponsorship, “official” support)
- **[The SDCoLab Path →]({{< relref "how-we-gather/sdcolab-path/_index.md" >}})** (space, tools, building)
