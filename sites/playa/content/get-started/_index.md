## Start a Thing 🚀

The best way to participate is to **do** something. Here's our mantra:

```
PROJECT → PARTY → PRACTICE
```

Start small. Prove it works. Keep what earns it.

### 🎯 Start a Project (Bounded)

Got an idea? Build it. Write it. Make it.

- Small projects can happen anywhere
- Bigger projects might need [CoLab space](../sdcolab/) or [SDCAP funding](../sdcap/grants/)

**Example:** "I want to build a light-up art piece for YOUtopia"

### 🎉 Start a Party (Time-boxed)

Host a gathering—potluck, workshop, practice session, theme night.

- Events don't need permission
- Just someone willing to make them happen

**Example:** "Let's do a monthly craft night"

### 🔄 Start a Practice (Ongoing)

Share a skill regularly. Consistency builds community.

- Weekly burn circle
- Monthly potluck
- Regular workshop series

**Example:** "Tuesday fire spinning at the park, every week"

## Your First Month 🐕

### Week 1: Sniff Around
- Join Discord, lurk, read
- Browse the [events calendar](/events/)
- Read the [culture page](/culture/)

### Week 2: Show Up Once
- Attend one event
- Talk to at least one person
- Don't stress about knowing things

### Week 3: Show Up Again
- Different event this time
- Start recognizing faces
- Ask questions you're curious about

### Week 4: Do Something
- Volunteer for something small
- Help with someone else's project
- OR start thinking about your own thing

**By month's end:** You'll know people. They'll know you. You'll belong.
