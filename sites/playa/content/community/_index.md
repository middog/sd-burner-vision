## Your Pack is Out There 🐕

San Diego's Burning Man community is a loose network of people who share values, not a formal organization. Here's how to find your people.

## Theme Camps

Theme camps are groups who come together around a shared concept—interactive experiences they create at events. San Diego has dozens of active camps, from chill lounges to fire-breathing chaos zones.

**How to find one:**
- Come to events and meet people
- Ask around on Discord
- Watch for camp recruitment posts before YOUtopia

**Want to start your own?** That's a **project → party → practice** journey. Start small, prove it works, grow from there.

## How We Communicate

| Channel | What It's For |
|---------|---------------|
| **Discord** | Day-to-day coordination, questions, chatter |
| **Mailing List** | Low-volume major announcements |
| **In Person** | The best communication (always) |

## I Just Moved Here

Welcome to the pack! 🐾 Here's your quick-start:

1. **Join the Discord** — Lurk first, post when ready
2. **Come to First Fridays** — Monthly open house at [SDCoLab](../sdcolab/)
3. **Pick one event** — [Check the calendar](/events/) and show up
4. **Repeat** — Until you recognize faces (usually 2-3 events)

That's it. No velvet ropes. No secret handshakes. Just show up and be real.

**Lost?** The [New Pup Orientation](/how-we-gather/new-pup/) has everything you need.
