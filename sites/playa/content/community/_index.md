## Community is a verb 🐾

San Diego Burners aren’t a single club with a single door. It’s a network of crews, camps, builders, performers, makers, and quiet contributors—connected by shared principles and repeated participation.

This page is a map to the humans.

## Where to meet people

- **Local gatherings** (potlucks, socials, decompressions) → start with **[Events]({{< relref "events/_index.md" >}})**
- **Build time** at **[SDCoLab]({{< xsite "sdcolab" >}})** (open hours, classes, build parties)
- **Regional event**: YOUtopia (seasonal momentum + camp formation)
- **Skill circles** (fire practice, flow jams, workshops)

If you go twice, you start recognizing faces. If you go three times, you start belonging.

## Theme camps

Theme camps are groups that build interactive experiences at events. Some are big and loud; some are tiny and precise. Most are always recruiting—quietly—through relationships.

How to find a camp:
- Show up to events and talk to people doing work
- Ask in community channels (Discord is usually the fastest)
- Watch for recruitment posts during YOUtopia season

Starting a camp is possible, but it’s work: begin as a **project**, host a **party**, and only then turn it into a **practice**.

## Where we communicate

| Channel | Best for |
|---|---|
| **Discord** | day‑to‑day coordination, questions, announcements |
| **Mailing list** | low‑volume “important dates” and major updates |
| **In person** | the real bandwidth (build days, hangs, events) |

## If you just moved here

1. Join the community channels (Discord / mailing list)
2. Attend one low‑stakes event (social, open house, potluck)
3. Introduce yourself to one person and learn one name
4. Come back once more within 30 days
