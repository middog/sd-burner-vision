## New to the culture? Start here 🧭🔥

Burning Man is a culture of participation, not a show you watch. The desert event is one expression of it—but the values live year‑round in regional communities like San Diego.

This site is the local front door: a place to understand what’s happening, how to join in, and what “doing your part” looks like.

## What exists in San Diego

The community is built as a three‑part system (the Fire Triangle):

- 🔥 **PLAYA (Heat):** gatherings, culture, the calendar, the people
- 🟡 **[SDCoLab]({{< xsite "sdcolab" >}}) (Fuel):** a makerspace for building art, gear, and infrastructure
- 🔵 **[SDCAP]({{< xsite "sdcap" >}}) (Oxygen):** a nonprofit that enables grants, sponsorship, and “official” support

Together, this supports events—including **YOUtopia**, our regional burn.

## A clean way to get involved

1. **Show up once** → start with **[Events]({{< relref "events/_index.md" >}})**
2. **Introduce yourself** → say hi, ask a simple question, learn names
3. **Offer something small** → help set up, clean up, bring a skill, bring a hand
4. **Repeat** → consistency turns strangers into collaborators

There’s no membership gate. Participation is the credential.
