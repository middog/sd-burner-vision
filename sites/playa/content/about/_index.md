## Welcome, Beautiful Human 🐾

Burning Man is a week-long annual event in Nevada's Black Rock Desert. But it's not just a festival—it's a culture built on radical creativity, self-expression, community, and gifting.

That culture lives year-round in regional communities like ours. **You found your pack.**

## What Happens in San Diego?

We're one of the largest regional Burning Man communities in California. Throughout the year, we:

- 🔥 Host events and gatherings (the **heat**)
- 🔧 Build art at [SDCoLab](../sdcolab/) (the **fuel**)
- 💨 Fund projects through [SDCAP](../sdcap/) (the **oxygen**)
- 🏜️ Produce **YOUtopia**—our annual regional burn

Together, these three elements create the fire. And you? **You're what makes it burn.**

## How Do I Get Involved?

**Show up.** That's the whole trick.

1. Come to an event — check the [calendar](/events/)
2. Say hi — we're friendly (we don't bite unless you ask nicely)
3. Participate — bring something to share, help clean up
4. Keep showing up — community is built through consistency

There's no application. No membership. No secret handshake. Just participation.
